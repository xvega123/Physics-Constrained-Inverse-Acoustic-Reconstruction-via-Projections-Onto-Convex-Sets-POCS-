## 📖 Overview
Conventional interpolation methods (e.g., Kriging, IDW) rely on smoothness priors that often suppress oscillatory wave physics, failing to capture diffraction patterns in measurement gaps. 

This project introduces a **training-free iterative solver** that enforces the **Acoustic Dispersion Relation** as a physical constraint. By iterating between data consistency (physical domain) and physics consistency (spectral domain), the algorithm successfully recovers complex topological features like interference fringes and spiral arms within large shadow zones.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Physics-Constrained Solver:** Uses a "Resonant Tapered Filter" in the spectral domain to enforce the Helmholtz equation without needing training data.
* **Superior Structural Fidelity:** Outperforms standard interpolants in Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) across various scenarios (e.g., Doppler sources, rotating quadrupoles).
* **Gap Filling & Extrapolation:** Capable of reconstructing fields in large shadow zones and extrapolating wave propagation beyond sparse sensor arrays.

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks
The proposed method was benchmarked against Linear Interpolation, IDW, and Kriging across five canonical scenarios.

| Benchmark Case | Normalized $L_2$ Error (Lower is Better) | SSIM (Higher is Better) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Translating Dipole** | **14.6%** (vs >80%) | **84.6%** (vs <57%) |
| **Doppler Source** ($M=0.5$) | **38.8%** (vs >70%) | **80.2%** (vs <60%) |
| **Rotating Quadrupole** | **26.0%** (vs >30%) | **78.1%** (vs <63%) |
| **Cylinder Scattering** | **84.7%** (Best) | **79.3%** (Best) |
